Here are the materials for the Streamlit part of the PyLadies Oslo meetup in June 2024.


## Follow along

You can download and extract [this](https://github.com/MarieRoald/streamlit-pyladies/archive/refs/heads/start-template.zip) zip file to follow along the presentation.
Once you have downloaded it, you should extract it and create a new virtual environment.
To create a virtual environment, open a terminal emulator (e.g. Powershell on Windows or Zsh on Mac) and run

```raw
python -m venv .venv
```

(you may need to replace `python` with `python3` on Linux or `py` on Windows).
Once you have created the virtual environment, you can activate it with

**Mac/Linux:**
```raw
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows:**
```raw
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Next, you can install the requirements (`streamlit`, `dhlab`, `plotly` and `jupyter`):

```raw
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
